# Overview

Indrz is composed of two parts: a [Django](https://djangoproject.com) powered [backend API](https://gitlab.com/indrz/indrz-backend) with
a Vue, Nuxt-powered [frontend](https://gitlab.com/indrz/indrz-frontend) and VuePress powered
Documentation with a [Plugin API](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/),
a [default theme](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html) optimized for 
writing technical documentation.

Each page generated by VuePress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great 
loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Once the page is loaded, however, Vue takes 
over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). 
Additional pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.
